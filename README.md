# UFOs.

## Overview
Dana is curious to learn about JavaScript and a few of its new updates. They would like to build an interactive webpage with the use of JS, Bootstrap, and CSS. Their knowledge of Python may come in handy, with some similarities they share.
Now that Dana has built a webpage, they would like to have users filter specific and various criteria simultaneously. This will help with a more detailed analysis of UFO sightings.

## Results
### How to perform a search
On the left side of the webpage, there are specific input text boxes with a placeholder set. Fill out your designated date, city, state, country, and shape in lower cases as the filters are case sensitive. This will output your suggested results.

## Summary
### Drawback
One drawback from this search is that it is case sensitive. This means that a user may not recieve results if their input is not exact.

### Recommendations
The first recommendation for this is to regard capital and lower case letters as one. And, the second recommendation is to output a result that is similar to what the user has typed.
